# Advent of Code

This repo will hold the code for the adventofcode challenges for each year. Certain years may be incomplete as I don't always have time to keep up the calendar after work but may be revisited as brain teasers in the future!

## Performance ranks

## Disclaimer
Challenges will be written in a few different langauges to add to the challenge and will be ranked based on performance. Each part of the challenge will be given its own rank and a running count will be kept above. Each day has more information in its own README
